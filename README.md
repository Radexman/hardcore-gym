# hardcore-gym
 Non commercial project for fictional gym.
 Project made with SCSS partials, mixins, functions
 and OOCSS metodology. I used BEM naming convencion.
 All pictures were used from Pexels, royality free
 pictures. I made custom animation for hamburger menu
 with CSS transitions and JS DOM manipulation.
 RWD is used in this project so it looks good
 on all kinds of devices. Small form at the end
 of webpage sends info to https/bin.
